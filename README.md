# RPG-music-app

the RPG Music app is a simple application that allows you to list and concurrently play the tracks you want to use in your RPG adventure.
The tracks fade in and out so that each scene of your campaign smoothly flows into the next one.

## Fire up the app

Build your app and gather all the necessary dependencies with
```
npm install
```

Then, start the server with
```
npm start
```

That's all!

Contributions are always welcome! I will gladly taak a look at your pull request.
