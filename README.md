the RPG Music app is a simple application that allows you to list and concurrently play the tracks you want to use in your RPG adventure.

## Fire up the app

Gather all the necessary dependencies with
```
npm install
```

Then, build your app and start the server with
```
npm start
```

That's all!

Contributions are always welcome! I will gladly take a look at your pull request.
